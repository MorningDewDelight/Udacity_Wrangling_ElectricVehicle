Wrangling on electric vehicle registered with Washington

Electric vehicles sales are souring in recent years to reduce pollution, people are becoming cautious about impact they make in global warming.

Here my question is how well EV sales in the state Washington compared to USA EV sales.I have Washington EV registration data programmatically dowloaded from data.gov and Global EV sales got from IEA website. These two are reliable sources,hence the data.

#### Dataset 1: Electric Vehicle Population of Washington state

This shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.

Type: CSV File

Method: The data was gathered using programmatically downloading method from DATA.GOV

Dataset variables:

    *Variable 1 'Electric Vehicle Type' - Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)
    *Variable 2 'Model Year'

#### Dataset 2: EV Sales data for all countries

Type: CSV File

Method: The data was gathered using the "Downloading files" method from Global EV Data Explorer

Dataset variables:

*   *Variable 1 'Year'
*   *Variable 2 'Value'(No. of EV vehicles sold)


Answer to research question:

 - Battery electric vehicle has huge share in all years for both Washigton and USA. 
 - But in 2021 Plugin hybrid vehicle gained market share of almost 5% in both data.
 - BEV market share is higher in WA compare to USA due to high volume of Tesla
